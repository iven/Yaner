This software depends on Python and PyGTK >= 2.12
sexy-python (libsexy bindings) is also used but optionnal.
Of course librsvg-common is needed for a proper svg support in gtk/gdk.

Run the setup.py script to install, e.g.:
    python setup.py install (as root, or with root rights using sudo)

To install it to /usr/local (or any other prefix) use:
    python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
(specify --prefix _after_ install or it won't work)

To uninstall, use:
    python setup.py uninstall (also as root, or with root rights using sudo)

Don't remove the file "installed_files", it's used for uninstallation.
